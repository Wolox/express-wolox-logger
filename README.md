# Express Wolox Logger

ExpressJS logger that wraps [pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino) with additional features like middlewares for unique request ids and automatic logging of request beginnings and endings.

## Basic Usage
```
const { logger } = require('express-wolox-logger');

logger.info('hello world');
logger.error('something bad happened');
```
This will output:
```
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): hello world
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] ERROR (17439 on my-pc.local): something bad happened
```

## Advanced Usage

The exported `createLogger` function takes one optional argument,
[`configuration`](#configuration) and
returns a `logger instance`.

<a id=configuration></a>
### `configuration` (Object)

#### `options` (Object)
Default (pino): `{
  prettyPrint: {
    translateTime: true,
    colorize: false
  }
}`

Options for logger instance, check documentation of each package for more details ([pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/master/docs/api.md#options))

#### `loggerOption` (String)
Default : `'pino'`

Package used as logger, available options are: `['pino']`

### Example
```
const { createLogger } = require('express-wolox-logger');

const logger = createLogger({ 
    loggerOption: 'pino',
    options: {
        customLevels: {
            foo: 35
        },
        useOnlyCustomLevels: true,
        level: 'foo'
    } 
})

logger.foo('hello world');
```

# Middlewares
## Logs for request beginning and end
We provide an ExpressJs middleware that automatically logs when a request starts and ends. Simply import it and use it like any other middleware:
```
const { logger, expressMiddleware } = require('express-wolox-logger');

app.use(expressMiddleware({ loggerFn: logger.info }));
```
This in conjunction with the basic logs will output:
```
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.770 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): Started GET /logger/test with params: {}, query: {}, body: {}.
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): hello world
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] ERROR (17439 on my-pc.local): something bad happened
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.781 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): Ended GET /logger/test with status: 200 in 10 ms
```

## Request Ids
We also provide an ExpressJs middleware that appends a `request id` to all logs made for a single request. This is useful for better tracking logs when there are several requests going on concurrently. Again, simply import it and use it like any other middleware.

### Basic Usage
```
const { expressRequestIdMiddleware } = require('express-wolox-logger');

app.use(expressRequestIdMiddleware());
```
This, in conjunction with the basic logs will output:
```
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): [GNc7JovB7] hello world
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] ERROR (17439 on my-pc.local): [GNc7JovB7] something bad happened
```

### Advanced Usage
The exported `expressRequestIdMiddleware` function takes one optional argument, [`options`](#options) and returns a `middleware`.

<a id=options></a>
#### `options` (Object)

##### `headerName` (String)
Default: `x-request-id`

Header from where the id is taken

##### `idGenerator` (Function)
Default: [shortid.generate](https://github.com/dylang/shortid#usage)

Function used for generate ids in each request.

### Example
```
const uuid = require('uuid');
const { expressRequestIdMiddleware } = require('express-wolox-logger');

app.use(expressRequestIdMiddleware({ headerName: 'id', idGenerator: uuid }));
```
This, in conjunction with the basic logs will output:
```
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] INFO  (17439 on my-pc.local): [a2936029-9bd4-402d-ba43-a4873f228274] hello world
[2019-06-14 17:35:13.772 +0000] ERROR (17439 on my-pc.local): [a2936029-9bd4-402d-ba43-a4873f228274] something bad happened
```

### Forwarding the request Id
As a bonus, the previously mentioned request id is taken from the `x-request-id` header if supplied, which lets said `request id` be transferred across services. You can do this by importing the `getRequestId` function and supplying it to the header when making requests.
```
const axios = require('axios'),
 { getRequestId } = require('express-wolox-logger');

axios.get(URL, { headers: { 'x-request-id': getRequestId() } });
```
This will result in the requestId being logged through your services until the request chain ends.

We used [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) for this example but other requets packages like [request-promise](https://github.com/request/request-promise) work exactly the same way.
